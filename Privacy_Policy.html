       I want to inform you that whenever you
       use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
       I collect data and information (through third party
       products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
       include information such as your device Internet Protocol
       (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the

       the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
       statistics.
     </p> <p><strong class="strong">Cookies</strong></p> <p>
       Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
       commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
       to your browser from the websites that you visit and are

       individuals due to the following reasons:

       I want to inform users of this Service
       that these third parties have access to your Personal
       Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
       them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
       disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
     </p> <p><strong class="strong">Security</strong></p> <p>
       I value your trust in providing us your

       acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
       of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
       storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
       guarantee its absolute security.
